[FakeM](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0076) has also included HTML code in C2 traffic in an apparent attempt to evade detection. Additionally, some variants of [FakeM](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0076) use modified SSL code for communications back to C2 servers, making SSL decryption ineffective.",
