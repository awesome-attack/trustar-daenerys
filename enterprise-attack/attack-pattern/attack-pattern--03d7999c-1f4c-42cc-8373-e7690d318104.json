They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs.\n\n### Mac\n\nOn Mac, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>users</code>,<code>w</code>, and <code>who</code>.\n\n### Linux\n\nOn Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>.",
