            "description": "Adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs and potentially captured files such as quarantined malware. Locations and format of logs will vary, but typical organic system logs are captured as Windows events or Linux/macOS files such as [Bash History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1139) and /var/log/* .\n\nActions that interfere with eventing and other notifications that can be used to detect intrusion activity may compromise the integrity of security solutions, causing events to go unreported. They may also make forensic analysis and incident response more difficult due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.\n\n### Clear Windows Event Logs\n\nWindows event logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. Microsoft defines an event as \"any significant occurrence in the system or in a program that requires users to be notified or an entry added to a log.\" There are three system-defined sources of Events: System, Application, and Security.\n \nAdversaries performing actions related to account management, account logon and directory service access, etc. may choose to clear the events in order to hide their activities.\n\nThe event logs can be cleared with the following utility commands:\n\n* <code>wevtutil cl system</code>\n* <code>wevtutil cl application</code>\n* <code>wevtutil cl security</code>\n\nLogs may also be cleared through other mechanisms, such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086).",
