            "description": "An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. This could include modifying sensor settings stored in configuration files and/or Registry keys to disable or maliciously redirect event telemetry. (Citation: Microsoft Lamin Sept 2017)\n\nIn the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis. This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products.",
