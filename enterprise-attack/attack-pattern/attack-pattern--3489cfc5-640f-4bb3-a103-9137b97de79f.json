(Citation: Wikipedia Shared Resource) (Citation: TechNet Shared Folder)\n\n[Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) can be used to query a remote system for available shared drives using the <code>net view \\\\remotesystem</code> command. It can also be used to query shared drives on the local system using <code>net share</code>.\n\nAdversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for Collection and to identify potential systems of interest for Lateral Movement.\n\n### Mac\n\nOn Mac, locally mounted shares can be viewed with the <code>df -aH</code> command.",
