            "description": "If the mobile device is connected (typically via USB) to a charging station or a PC, for example to charge the device's battery, then a compromised or malicious charging station or PC could attempt to exploit the mobile device via the connection.\n\nKrebs described this technique in (Citation: Krebs-JuiceJacking). Lau et al. (Citation: Lau-Mactans) demonstrated the ability to inject malicious applications into an iOS device via USB. Hay (Citation: IBM-NexusUSB) demonstrated the ability to exploit a Nexus 6 or 6P device over USB and then gain the ability to perform actions including intercepting phone calls, intercepting network traffic, and obtaining the device physical location. Horn (Citation: GoogleProjectZero-OATmeal) demonstrated the ability to exploit Android devices such as the Google Pixel 2 over USB.\n\nProducts from Cellebrite and Grayshift purportedly can use physical access to the data port to unlock the passcode on some iOS devices (Citation: Computerworld-iPhoneCracking).",
