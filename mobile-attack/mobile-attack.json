Mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store).

D. Komaromy and N. Golde demonstrated baseband exploitation of a Samsung mobile device at the PacSec 2015 security conference. (Citation: Register-BaseStation) Weinmann described and demonstrated \"the risk of remotely exploitable memory corruptions in cellular baseband stacks.\" (Citation: Weinmann-Baseband)\n\n### Malicious SMS Message\n\nAn SMS message could contain content designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the SMS parser on the receiving device. For example, Mulliner and Miller demonstrated such an attack against the iPhone in 2009. (Citation: Forbes-iPhoneSMS) An SMS message could also contain a link to a web site containing malicious content designed to exploit the device web browser.

            "description": "An adversary with physical access to a mobile device may seek to bypass the device's lockscreen.\n\n### Biometric Spoofing\nIf biometric authentication is used, an adversary could attempt to spoof a mobile device's biometric authentication mechanism. For example, SRLabs (Citation: SRLabs-Fingerprint) describes providing a fake fingerprint, and SecureIDNews describes similar work by Michigan State University (Citation: SecureIDNews-Spoof). The Sun describes a case where someone else's face was able to unlock an iPhone X with Face ID (Citation: TheSun-FaceID).\n\niOS partly mitigates this attack by requiring the device passcode rather than a fingerprint to unlock the device after every device restart and after 48 hours since the device was last unlocked (Citation: Apple-TouchID). Android has similar mitigations.\n\n### Device Unlock Code Guessing or Brute Force\nAn adversary could attempt to brute-force or otherwise guess the lockscreen passcode (typically a PIN or password), including physically observing (\"shoulder surfing\") the device owner's use of the lockscreen passcode. \n\n### Exploit Other Device Lockscreen Vulnerabilities\nTechniques have periodically been demonstrated that exploit vulnerabilities on Android (Citation: Wired-AndroidBypass), iOS (Citation: Kaspersky-iOSBypass), or other mobile devices to bypass the device lockscreen. The vulnerabilities are generally patched by the device/operating system vendor once they become aware of their existence.",

Somewhat related, adversaries could also identify and exploit inadvertently present vulnerabilities. In many cases, it may be difficult to be certain whether exploitable functionality is due to malicious intent or simply inadvertent mistake.\n\nRelated PRE-ATT&CK techniques include:\n\n* [Identify vulnerabilities in third-party software libraries](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1389) - Third-party libraries incorporated into mobile apps could contain malicious behavior, privacy-invasive behavior, or exploitable vulnerabilities. An adversary could deliberately insert malicious behavior or could exploit inadvertent vulnerabilities. For example, Ryan Welton of NowSecure identified exploitable remote code execution vulnerabilities in a third-party advertisement library (Citation: NowSecure-RemoteCode). Grace et al. identified security issues in mobile advertisement libraries (Citation: Grace-Advertisement).\n* [Distribute malicious software development tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1394) - As demonstrated by the XcodeGhost attack (Citation: PaloAlto-XcodeGhost1), app developers could be provided with modified versions of software development tools (e.g. compilers) that automatically inject malicious or exploitable code into applications.",

            "description": "User Interface Spoofing can be used to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as account credentials, bank account information, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to an unintended entity.\n\nAt least three methods exist to perform User Interface Spoofing:\n\nFirst, on both Android and iOS, an adversary could impersonate the user interface of a legitimate app or device function to trick a user into entering sensitive information. The constrained display size of mobile devices (compared to traditional PC displays) may impair the ability to provide the user with contextual information (for example, displaying a full web site address) that may alert the user to a potential issue. (Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices) As described by PRE-ATT&CK ([Spearphishing for information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1397)), it is also possible for an adversary to carry out this form of the technique without a direct adversary presence on the mobile devices, e.g. through a spoofed web page.\n\nSecond, on both Android and iOS, a malicious app could impersonate the identity of another app (e.g. use the same app name and/or icon) and somehow get installed on the device (e.g. using [Deliver Malicious App via Authorized App Store](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1475) or [Deliver Malicious App via Other Means](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1476). The malicious app could then prompt the user for sensitive information. (Citation: eset-finance)\n\nThird, on older versions of Android, a malicious app could abuse mobile operating system features to interfere with a running legitimate app. (Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices) (Citation: Hassell-ExploitingAndroid) However, this technique appears to have been addressed starting in Android 5.0 with the deprecation of the Android's ActivityManager.getRunningTasks method and modification of its behavior (Citation: Android-getRunningTasks) and further addressed in Android 5.1.1 (Citation: StackOverflow-getRunningAppProcesses) to prevent a malicious app from determining what app is currently in the foreground.",

Developers should be encouraged to use techniques to ensure that the intent can only be sent to an appropriate destination (e.g., use explicit rather than implicit intents, permission checking, checking of the destination app's signing certificate, or the App Links feature added in Android 6.0). For mobile applications using OAuth, encourage use of the best practices described in the IETF draft \"OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps\".",

Unfortunately, this mitigation is likely impractical, as many legitimate applications apply code obfuscation or encryption to resist adversary techniques such as Repackaged Application. Dynamic analysis when used in application vetting may in some cases be able to identify malicious code in obfuscated or encrypted form by detecting the code at execution time (after it is deobfuscated or decrypted). Some application vetting techniques apply reputation analysis of the application developer and can alert to potentially suspicious applications without actual examination of application code.",

            "description": "Enterprises can provision policies to mobile devices to require a minimum complexity (length, etc.) for the device passcode. Enterprises can provision policies to mobile devices to cause the device to wipe all data if an incorrect passcode is entered too many times. Both policies would mitigate brute-force, guessing, or shoulder surfing of the device passcode. If desired, enterprises can provision policies to mobile devices to disallow biometric authentication. However, as described by Apple's iOS Security Guide, biometric authentication can help make \"using a longer, more complex passcode far more practical because you don't need to enter it as frequently.\"",

There are many ways an adversary can establish command and control with various levels of covertness, depending on system configuration and network topology. Due to the wide degree of variation available to the adversary at the network level, only the most common factors were used to describe the differences in command and control. There are still a great many specific techniques within the documented methods, largely due to how easy it is to define new protocols and use existing, legitimate protocols and network services for communication. \n\nThe resulting breakdown should help convey the concept that detecting intrusion through command and control protocols without prior knowledge is a difficult proposition over the long term. Adversaries' main constraints in network-level defense avoidance are testing and deployment of tools to rapidly change their protocols, awareness of existing defensive technologies, and access to legitimate Web services that, when used appropriately, make their tools difficult to distinguish from benign traffic.\n\nAdditionally, in the mobile environment, mobile devices are frequently connected to networks outside enterprise control such as cellular networks or public Wi-Fi networks. Adversaries could attempt to evade detection by communicating on these networks, and potentially even by using non-Internet Protocol mechanisms such as Short Message Service (SMS). However, cellular networks often have data caps and/or extra data charges that could increase the potential for adversarial communication to be detected.",
